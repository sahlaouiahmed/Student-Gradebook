# Student Gradebook
This Python project allows users to manage student data efficiently. Users can enter each student’s first and last name, along with their grades in various subjects. The program then processes this data to:

1. Validate the entered information.
2. Calculate the average grade for each student.
3. Determine the rank of each student based on their average grade.
4. Assign a grade of success.
5. Evaluate the student’s status as pass or fail.

This project aims to streamline the process of student evaluation, making it easier for educators to track and analyze student performance.
